## NLP-Named-Entity-Recognition-Using-LSTM-and-Bert
Two Notebooks are included in this Repo for Named Entity Recognition:
1. Bidirectional LSTM Tensorflow for Named Entity Recognition.
2. Bert Tensorflow for Named Entity Recognition.

Bert: Train_acc: 0.9961, Validate_acc: 0.9938

LSTM: Train_acc: 0.9904, Validate_acc: 0.9806

Bert outperforms LSTM and gives precise prediction.

Dataset is downloaded from Kaggle "Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition":
